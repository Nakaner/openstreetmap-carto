# HolperHolper

HolperHolper is an overlay map style rendering road surface information. It
shows an halo around almost all roads indicating their surface. It is derived
from the [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

These stylesheets can be used in your own cartography projects, and are designed
to be easily customised. They work with [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik)
 and also with the command-line [CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto) processor.

# Installation
